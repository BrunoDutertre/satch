Since we are still in an initial version phase where many things are missing
and for the next future use the GitHub repository for releases only we will
not accept pull-requests.  If you have an issue or enhancement proposal
please use the issue tracker or send email to 'armin.biere@gmail.com'
instead of generating pull-requests.
